You are an expert web developer. Your task is to create the foundational HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a Replit project based on the provided Korean project document: "대전시 외국인 주민을 위한 웹사이트 구축 프로젝트."

The website aims to be an Information & Referral (I&R) hub for foreign residents in Daejeon, South Korea.

**Project Title:** Website for Foreign Residents in Daejeon

**Core Requirements (from the document):**

1.  **Target Audience:** Foreign residents in Daejeon, particularly:
    *   Students (유학생)
    *   Foreign Workers (외국인근로자)
    *   Marriage Immigrants (결혼이민자)
2.  **Purpose:** Help foreign residents settle, minimize daily life inconveniences, and provide practical, integrated living information and connections to relevant services.
3.  **Key Design Considerations (from Section 5.1):**
    *   **Multilingual Support:** Initially, implement a simple language switcher for Korean (기본) and English. Add placeholders for future languages like Vietnamese and Chinese.
    *   **High Design Flexibility & UX:** The design should be intuitive, visually clear, and easy to navigate, especially for those not fluent in Korean. Avoid complex menus. Use images/icons where helpful.
    *   **Easy External Linking:** Key function is to link to external resources. Present these links clearly.
    *   **Ease of Maintenance:** Structure the code cleanly for future updates.
